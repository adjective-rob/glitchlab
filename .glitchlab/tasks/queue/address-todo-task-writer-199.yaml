objective: Resolve the TODO comment at glitchlab/auditor/task_writer.py:199 by implementing
  the intended behavior for the TODO/FIXME message formatting and removing the TODO
  marker.
constraints:
- Modify only glitchlab/auditor/task_writer.py.
- Preserve existing runtime behavior aside from the specific TODO-related message
  formatting at the referenced location.
acceptance:
- The TODO comment at glitchlab/auditor/task_writer.py:199 is removed and replaced
  with implemented code.
- All existing automated tests (if present) pass without modification.
risk: low
