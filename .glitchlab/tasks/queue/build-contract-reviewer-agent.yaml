id: build-contract-reviewer-agent
mode: evolution
objective: |
  Create a new agent called `ContractReviewerAgent` in `glitchlab/agents/contract_reviewer.py`.
  This agent acts as the final gatekeeper for an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.
  It must inherit from `BaseAgent`. 
  Its system prompt must instruct it to review the Implementer's proposed FastAPI code and Pydantic schemas. It must strictly reject any code that uses `Any` typing, lacks field descriptions, or fails to return the required MCP 'Metrics Receipt' wrapper (compute_time, actions_performed, confidence_score).
  It should output JSON containing an 'approved' boolean, and a 'rejection_reasons' list.
constraints:
  - "Must inherit from glitchlab.agents.BaseAgent"
  - "System prompt must specifically mention Pydantic v2, FastAPI, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) standards."
  - "Output schema must strictly separate approval status from the list of required fixes."
acceptance:
  - "glitchlab/agents/contract_reviewer.py exists."
  - "The role attribute is 'contract_reviewer'."
  - "The prompt enforces the 'Metrics Receipt' wrapper."
