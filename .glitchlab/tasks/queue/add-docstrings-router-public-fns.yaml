id: add-docstrings-router-public-fns
objective: Add clear Python docstrings to the public functions `tokens_remaining`,
  `dollars_remaining`, `budget_exceeded`, `summary`, and `complete` in glitchlab/router.py
  describing their purpose, parameters, and return values.
constraints:
- Modify only glitchlab/router.py.
- Do not change any runtime behavior, function signatures, routing, or business logic;
  documentation-only changes.
acceptance:
- Each of the listed public functions in glitchlab/router.py contains a non-empty
  docstring.
- All existing tests and linters (if present in the repo) pass with no code changes
  beyond docstrings.
risk: low
