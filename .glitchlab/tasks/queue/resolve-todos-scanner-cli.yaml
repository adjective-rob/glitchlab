id: resolve-todos-scanner-cli
objective: Resolve the TODO placeholders in glitchlab/cli.py and glitchlab/auditor/scanner.py
  by either implementing the intended small missing pieces or replacing them with
  clear, specific comments, and remove obsolete TODO/FIXME markers.
constraints:
- Limit changes to glitchlab/cli.py and glitchlab/auditor/scanner.py only.
- Do not change user-facing CLI behavior or scanner finding semantics; only address
  the TODOs with equivalent behavior or clarifying comments.
acceptance:
- All listed TODO/FIXME comments at the referenced lines are removed or replaced with
  explicit, non-TODO comments explaining the final decision.
- Project test suite (if present) and lint/type checks (if present) run successfully
  with no new failures.
risk: low
