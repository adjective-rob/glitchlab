id: add-cli-docstrings-batch-history-audit
objective: Add clear docstrings to the public functions `batch`, `history`, and `audit`
  in glitchlab/cli.py describing their purpose, parameters, behavior, and any notable
  side effects.
constraints:
- Modify only glitchlab/cli.py.
- Do not change runtime behavior, control flow, function signatures, or CLI output;
  documentation-only changes.
acceptance:
- Functions `batch` (around line 340), `history` (around line 389), and `audit` (around
  line 466) in glitchlab/cli.py each have a non-empty docstring.
- All existing tests and checks pass (e.g., running the project's standard test suite)
  with no functional changes.
risk: low
