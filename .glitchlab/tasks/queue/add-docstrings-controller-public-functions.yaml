id: add-docstrings-controller-public-functions
objective: Add clear, accurate docstrings to the public functions `from_yaml`, `from_interactive`,
  `apply_changes`, and `apply_tests` in glitchlab/controller.py describing their purpose,
  parameters, return values, and any raised exceptions.
constraints:
- Modify only glitchlab/controller.py.
- Do not change runtime logic, control flow, function signatures, or imports; documentation-only
  changes.
- Docstrings must reflect current behavior and not introduce new functionality or
  claims.
acceptance:
- glitchlab/controller.py contains docstrings for `from_yaml`, `from_interactive`,
  `apply_changes`, and `apply_tests`.
- All existing tests (if present) pass with no code behavior changes.
- The missing_doc findings for glitchlab/controller.py at the reported lines are resolved.
risk: low
