id: add-docstrings-build-messages
objective: Add concise, accurate docstrings to the public function `build_messages`
  in `glitchlab/agents/planner.py` and `glitchlab/agents/debugger.py` describing purpose,
  parameters, and return value.
constraints:
- Do not change any runtime behavior, function signatures, imports, or formatting
  outside of adding docstrings.
- Limit changes strictly to the two affected files and only around the `build_messages`
  functions.
acceptance:
- '`build_messages` in `glitchlab/agents/planner.py` has a docstring.'
- '`build_messages` in `glitchlab/agents/debugger.py` has a docstring.'
risk: low
