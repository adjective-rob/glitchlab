id: add-missing-docstrings-parallel-tools
objective: Add docstrings to the public functions `run_parallel` (glitchlab/parallel.py)
  and `success`, `execution_log`, `clear_log` (glitchlab/workspace/tools.py) describing
  their purpose, parameters, return values, and any notable side effects.
constraints:
- Do not change runtime logic, control flow, function signatures, imports, or public
  APIs; documentation-only edits.
- Docstrings must be accurate and reflect current behavior without adding new features
  or assumptions.
acceptance:
- Each flagged public function has a non-empty docstring in its defining file.
- All existing tests (if present) and lint/type-check steps (if present) pass with
  no functional changes.
risk: low
