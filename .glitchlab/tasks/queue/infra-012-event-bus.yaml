objective: "Implement a lightweight, agnostic Event Bus to decouple core system actions from external logging/cryptography."
steps:
  - "Modify the existing file: 'glitchlab/event_bus.py'."
  - "Define a 'GlitchEvent' Pydantic model..."
  - "Create an 'EventBus' class..."
  - "Modify the existing file 'tests/test_event_bus.py' to add unit tests."
constraints:
  - "Do not modify any existing router or tool code yet; this is purely foundational."
  - "Do not add any cryptography or Zephyr-specific logic. Keep it purely structural."
  - "Ensure thread safety is not strictly required yet, but keep the implementation clean."
  - "You MUST use the provided tool to create the files. Do not output the code in your conversational response."
