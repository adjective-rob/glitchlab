id: fix-scanner-todo-fixme-notes
objective: Resolve the inline TODO/FIXME notes in glitchlab/auditor/scanner.py around
  TODO/FIXME comment scanning by clarifying intent and removing placeholder TODO/FIXME
  markers while preserving current behavior.
constraints:
- Modify only glitchlab/auditor/scanner.py.
- Do not change runtime logic or output; comment-only edits are allowed.
- Do not rename public APIs or alter regex behavior.
acceptance:
- No lines containing 'TODO:' or 'FIXME:' remain in glitchlab/auditor/scanner.py.
- Existing test suite (if present) passes without modification.
risk: low
