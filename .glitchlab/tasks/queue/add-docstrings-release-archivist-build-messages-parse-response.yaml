id: add-docstrings-release-archivist-build-messages-parse-response
objective: 'Add concise Python docstrings to the public functions missing documentation:
  `build_messages` in `glitchlab/agents/archivist.py`, `build_messages` in `glitchlab/agents/release.py`,
  and `parse_response` in `glitchlab/agents/release.py`.'
constraints:
- Modify only docstrings/comments; do not change function signatures, logic, imports,
  or formatting outside the added docstrings.
- Do not add new tests or refactor code; keep changes limited to the two affected
  files.
acceptance:
- Each of the three specified public functions has a non-empty docstring describing
  purpose, inputs, and return value at a high level.
- All existing tests and checks pass with no behavior changes (e.g., current test
  suite completes successfully).
risk: low
