id: add-docstrings-build-messages-agents
objective: Add concise, accurate docstrings to the public function `build_messages`
  in `glitchlab/agents/test_engineer.py` and `glitchlab/agents/security.py`, describing
  purpose, parameters, and return value at a high level.
constraints:
- Modify only docstrings/comments/whitespace in the two affected files; do not change
  any runtime logic, function signatures, imports, or behavior.
- Docstrings must reflect current behavior as implemented; do not introduce new examples
  or claims that require code changes.
acceptance:
- '`build_messages` in `glitchlab/agents/test_engineer.py` has a docstring directly
  under its `def` line.'
- '`build_messages` in `glitchlab/agents/security.py` has a docstring directly under
  its `def` line.'
risk: low
