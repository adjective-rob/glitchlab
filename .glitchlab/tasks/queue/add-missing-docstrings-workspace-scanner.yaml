id: add-missing-docstrings-workspace-scanner
objective: Add concise, accurate docstrings to the public functions `path` in `glitchlab/workspace/__init__.py`
  and `by_kind` and `summary` in `glitchlab/auditor/scanner.py`, describing purpose,
  parameters, return values, and any notable behavior.
constraints:
- Do not change runtime logic, signatures, imports, or behavior; documentation-only
  edits.
- Keep docstrings consistent with existing project style and terminology.
acceptance:
- Each of the three public functions (`path`, `by_kind`, `summary`) has a non-empty
  docstring directly under its definition.
- Running the existing test suite (e.g., `pytest`) succeeds with no failures.
risk: low
