id: add-docstring-build-messages
objective: Add a complete docstring to the public function `build_messages` in `glitchlab/agents/implementer.py`
  describing its purpose, parameters, return value, and any notable behavior.
description: |
  Add docstrings to build_messages. PROVIDE ONLY SURGICAL PATCHES. DO NOT return the full file content.
constraints:
- Do not change any runtime logic, control flow, or function signatures; documentation-only
  change.
- Limit modifications to `glitchlab/agents/implementer.py`.
acceptance:
- '`glitchlab/agents/implementer.py` contains a docstring immediately under `def build_messages(...)`
  that documents inputs and outputs.'
- All existing tests and checks pass with no other code changes beyond adding the
  docstring.
risk: low
