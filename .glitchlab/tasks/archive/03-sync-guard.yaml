objective: "Add a remote-sync check to the Execution Guard."
steps:
  - "Update the Controller's Guard logic to run 'git fetch' at the start of a task."
  - "Compare the local HEAD with the remote origin/main."
  - "If the local branch is behind, abort the task with a clear message: 'Please pull remote changes first.'"
constraints:
  - "Do not perform an automatic pull; only alert the user to prevent accidental merge conflicts."
