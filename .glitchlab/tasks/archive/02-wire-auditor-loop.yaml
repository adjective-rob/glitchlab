objective: "Inject the Auditor into the execution loop to catch performance smells."
steps:
  - "In 'glitchlab/controller.py', locate the point after 'implementer.run' completes but BEFORE 'security.run'."
  - "Call 'self.auditor.run()' with the implementation context."
  - "If the auditor returns a 'reject' or 'fail' status, log the performance warning and set 'implementation_failed'."
constraints:
  - "Ensure the auditor's feedback is captured in the session history."
