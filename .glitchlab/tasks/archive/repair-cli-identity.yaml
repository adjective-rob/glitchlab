objective: "Restore CLI functionality by creating the identity file and implementing missing helper functions."
steps:
  - "Create 'glitchlab/__init__.py' with __version__, __codename__, and __tagline__."
  - "Implement the missing '_detect_test_command' and '_configure_logging' helpers at the bottom of 'glitchlab/cli.py'."
  - "Verify the 'batch' command correctly references the Controller logic."
constraints:
  - "Do not remove the Banner or existing command structure."
  - "Ensure imports at the top of cli.py match the new __init__.py exactly."
