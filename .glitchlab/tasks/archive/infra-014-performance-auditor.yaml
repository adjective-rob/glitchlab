objective: "Implement a Performance Auditor agent that checks for I/O inefficiencies and resource leaks."
steps:
  - "Create a new file: 'glitchlab/agents/auditor.py' implementing the 'AuditorAgent' class."
  - "The agent should look for 'file.open()' inside loops or frequent function calls without context managers."
  - "Integrate the Auditor into the 'Controller.run()' loop after the Implementer but before the Security scan."
  - "If the Auditor finds a performance smell, it should trigger a 'REJECT' status with specific feedback."
constraints:
  - "Inherit from 'BaseAgent'."
  - "Use 'gemini-3.5-flash' for high-speed, low-cost auditing."
