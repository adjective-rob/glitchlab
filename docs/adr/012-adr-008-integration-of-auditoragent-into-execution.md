# ADR-008: Integration of AuditorAgent into Execution Pipeline

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-27

## Context

The execution loop lacked automated performance oversight, leading to potential accumulation of technical debt and inefficient code generation without immediate feedback loops.

## Decision

Injected the AuditorAgent directly into the controller's execution pipeline. The auditor now intercepts the generated code, evaluates it for performance smells, and injects its findings back into the session history as a system-level feedback loop.

## Consequences

Every execution cycle now includes a performance analysis overhead. While this slightly increases latency per turn, it ensures that performance constraints are part of the iterative refinement process. Developers/Agents will receive immediate warnings about suboptimal patterns.

## Alternatives Considered

- Post-execution batch auditing
- Optional flag-based auditing
- External microservice for performance analysis
