# ADR-014: Introduction of Performance Auditor Agent

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

As the GLITCHLAB ecosystem grows, manual detection of I/O inefficiencies and resource leaks (e.g., unclosed file handles, database connections) has become a bottleneck for system reliability.

## Decision

Implemented a specialized 'PerformanceAuditorAgent' leveraging the 'gemini-3.5-flash' model. This agent is integrated into the standard agent registry and is responsible for static and dynamic analysis of resource management patterns.

## Consequences

Developers can now automate performance linting. However, relying on an LLM for leak detection may introduce false positives compared to deterministic profiling tools; results should be treated as advisory.

## Alternatives Considered

- Static analysis using Grep/Regex patterns
- Integration of Valgrind or similar low-level profilers
- Manual peer review checklists
