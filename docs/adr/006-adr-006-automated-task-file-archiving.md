# ADR-006: Automated Task File Archiving

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The system lacked a mechanism to manage processed task files, leading to potential clutter in the 'queue/' directory and difficulty in tracking historical task execution without manual intervention.

## Decision

Modified the Controller to automatically relocate task definition files from 'queue/' to 'archive/' upon successful execution. This was achieved by adding a 'file_path' attribute to the Task model to track origin and implementing a post-execution move logic in the Controller's run loop.

## Consequences

The 'queue/' directory remains clean and represents only pending work. The 'archive/' directory now serves as a historical record. Systems relying on the presence of files in 'queue/' must be aware that files are ephemeral. Error handling must ensure files are not archived if the task fails.

## Alternatives Considered

- Deleting files after completion
- Leaving files in place and marking them with a '.done' suffix
- Database-only tracking without file movement
