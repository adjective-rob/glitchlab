# ADR-002: CLI Version Flag Implementation

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

Users needed a standard way to verify the installed version of GLITCHLAB via the command line interface without executing specific commands.

## Decision

Implemented a global `--version` flag using a Typer callback in the main entry point. This callback pulls the version string directly from `glitchlab.__version__` and raises a `typer.Exit()` to prevent further command execution.

## Consequences

The version is now centrally managed in the package root and accessible via the CLI. Any future version bumps in the code will automatically reflect in the CLI output.

## Alternatives Considered

- Hardcoding the version in cli.py
- Adding a 'version' subcommand instead of a flag
