# ADR-008: Engine Memory Restoration and Universal Initialization

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The engine memory updates in the Prelude module were failing silently or providing misleading 'Update failed' errors, causing friction during state persistence. Additionally, the CLI initialization process was overly verbose, requiring explicit path declarations even for standard setups.

## Decision

Restored the memory persistence logic in `glitchlab/prelude.py` with enhanced logging to distinguish between 'no-op' states and actual failures. Modified `glitchlab/cli.py` to implement a 'Universal Init' pattern where the current working directory is the default target, while maintaining support for legacy explicit path arguments.

## Consequences

Developers will see more accurate logs regarding engine state. The onboarding UX is simplified (one command vs. command + path). Backward compatibility is preserved for existing CI/CD pipelines using explicit paths.

## Alternatives Considered

- Strict enforcement of explicit paths (rejected for UX friction)
- Removing memory persistence entirely (rejected as it is a core feature)
