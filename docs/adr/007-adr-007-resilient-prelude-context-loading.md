# ADR-007: Resilient Prelude Context Loading

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The [PRELUDE] system failed to initialize the Planner when the remote update of failure patterns failed, causing a hard crash instead of falling back to cached or default patterns.

## Decision

Modified the `refresh` method in `glitchlab/prelude.py` to return a success boolean (`True`) even if the network-dependent `update` call fails. This ensures the Planner can proceed with existing local context.

## Consequences

The system is now more resilient to network instability. However, the Planner may operate on stale failure patterns if the update fails silently, though this is preferable to a complete initialization failure.

## Alternatives Considered

- Implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Hardcoding a minimal set of failure patterns as a static fallback
