# ADR-001: Centralized Versioning and CLI Exposure

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The project lacked a single source of truth for the version string, making it difficult to maintain and inaccessible to users via the command line interface.

## Decision

Defined the version string in the package root (`__init__.py`) and implemented a Typer callback in the CLI module to handle the `--version` flag.

## Consequences

Developers must now update the version in the package root only. Users can verify the installed version using `glitchlab --version`.

## Alternatives Considered

- Hardcoding the version in setup.py/pyproject.toml only
- Using importlib.metadata to fetch version at runtime
