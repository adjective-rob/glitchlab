# ADR-012: Agnostic Event Bus for System Decoupling

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The system required a way to trigger side effects (logging, cryptography, auditing) without tightly coupling core business logic to infrastructure-specific implementations. Direct dependencies were making the core difficult to test and extend.

## Decision

Implemented a lightweight, synchronous Event Bus pattern. The bus allows modules to publish events identified by string keys and allows multiple subscribers to register callbacks for those keys. The implementation is agnostic of the payload structure to ensure maximum flexibility.

## Consequences

Core logic is now decoupled from side effects. However, since the implementation is currently synchronous, long-running subscribers could potentially block the main execution thread. Developers must ensure subscriber callbacks are performant or handle their own async scheduling.

## Alternatives Considered

- Direct dependency injection of observers
- External message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- Node.js built-in EventEmitter (rejected to maintain environment agnosticism)
