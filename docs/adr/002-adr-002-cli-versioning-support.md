# ADR-002: CLI Versioning Support

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

Users needed a standard way to verify the installed version of GLITCHLAB via the command line interface to ensure compatibility and assist in debugging.

## Decision

Implemented a global `--version` flag using a Typer callback. The version string is sourced dynamically from `glitchlab.__version__` to maintain a single source of truth.

## Consequences

The CLI now supports standard version interrogation. Any future version bumps in the package will automatically reflect in the CLI output.

## Alternatives Considered

- Hardcoding version string in cli.py
- Using a sub-command 'glitchlab version' instead of a flag
