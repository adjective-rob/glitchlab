# ADR-004: Unified Console Output Prefixing

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The GLITCHLAB CLI output was indistinguishable from standard shell output or other tool logs, making it difficult for users to identify which process was emitting specific messages during complex operations.

## Decision

Implemented a unified logging prefix '[GLITCHLAB]' across all primary output modules (cli.py, controller.py). This was achieved by wrapping the Rich console print method to ensure consistent branding and visibility.

## Consequences

Improved log traceability and brand consistency. However, this adds a small overhead to string processing and may affect automated parsing of CLI output if regex patterns do not account for the prefix.

## Alternatives Considered

- Using standard Python logging with a custom formatter
- Implementing a Rich 'Theme' (rejected as themes don't easily support constant string prefixes)
