# ADR-005: Integration of PerformanceAuditorAgent into Core Controller

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-27

## Context

The system required a centralized mechanism to monitor and audit the performance metrics of various agents and sub-processes managed by the GLITCHLAB Controller.

## Decision

We have integrated the PerformanceAuditorAgent directly into the Controller's lifecycle. It is now instantiated during the Controller's initialization phase to ensure telemetry is captured from the start of operations.

## Consequences

All controller-managed tasks are now subject to performance auditing. This introduces a minor overhead for metric collection but provides critical visibility into system bottlenecks.

## Alternatives Considered

- Lazy-loading the auditor only when performance issues are detected
- Running the auditor as a standalone sidecar process
