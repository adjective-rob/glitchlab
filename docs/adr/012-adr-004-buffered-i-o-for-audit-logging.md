# ADR-004: Buffered I/O for Audit Logging

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-27

## Context

The AuditLogger was performing synchronous, unbuffered disk writes for every log entry, leading to significant I/O overhead and performance degradation under high load.

## Decision

Implemented an internal memory buffer within the AuditLogger. Log entries are now accumulated in memory and flushed to disk only when the buffer reaches a specific threshold or an explicit flush command is issued.

## Consequences

Significantly reduced disk I/O operations and improved application throughput. However, there is a minor risk of losing the most recent log entries in the event of an unhandled hard crash before a flush occurs.

## Alternatives Considered

- Asynchronous logging via a separate thread
- Using system-level syslog instead of local file I/O
