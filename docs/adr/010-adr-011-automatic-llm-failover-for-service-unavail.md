# ADR-011: Automatic LLM Failover for Service Unavailability

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The system relied on Gemini as a primary provider. Frequent 503 Service Unavailable errors were causing downstream task failures and reducing system reliability during peak usage or provider instability.

## Decision

Implemented a failover mechanism within the Router's `complete` method. If a Gemini model call returns a 503 error, the Router automatically re-routes the request to `openai/gpt-4o` as a fallback.

## Consequences

Increased system resilience and uptime. However, this introduces potential cost fluctuations (OpenAI pricing vs Gemini) and slight variations in output formatting due to model switching. Latency may increase during the failover event due to the initial failed attempt.

## Alternatives Considered

- Exponential backoff and retry on the same provider
- Circuit breaker pattern at the infrastructure level
- Returning a standardized error to the client for manual retry
