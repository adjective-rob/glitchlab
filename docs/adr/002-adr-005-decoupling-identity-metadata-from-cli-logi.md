# ADR-005: Decoupling Identity Metadata from CLI Logic

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The CLI was failing due to missing helper functions and hardcoded identity strings that were inconsistent across the package. The banner and versioning logic were tightly coupled with the command definitions, making maintenance difficult.

## Decision

Extracted identity metadata (banners, version info, branding) into a dedicated `glitchlab/identity.py` module and refactored `glitchlab/cli.py` to utilize this central source. Implemented missing helper functions required for CLI execution flow.

## Consequences

Centralized branding and versioning. Future changes to the CLI's visual identity only require modifications to `identity.py`. CLI logic is now cleaner and focused on command execution.

## Alternatives Considered

- Hardcoding strings directly in cli.py
- Using a pyproject.toml parser for all identity metadata
