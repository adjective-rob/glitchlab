# ADR-005: Standardization of CLI Initialization and Agent Taxonomy

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The project expanded to 5 specialized agents and required a more intuitive CLI entry point. Previous documentation lacked clarity on the modular governance and workspace structure.

## Decision

Unified the initialization command to `glitchlab init` (defaulting to PWD) and formalized the 5-agent roster (Zap, Patch, Reroute, Frankie, Sam). Explicitly documented the 'governance' and 'workspace' modules as core architectural pillars.

## Consequences

Simplifies onboarding for new users. Establishes a clear separation of concerns between agent logic (governance) and file operations (workspace). Future agents must fit into this established roster structure.

## Alternatives Considered

- Maintaining separate init commands for different templates
- Keeping agent descriptions in list format
