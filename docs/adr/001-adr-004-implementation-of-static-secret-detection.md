# ADR-004: Implementation of Static Secret Detection

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The auditor lacked the capability to identify sensitive information such as API keys or credentials stored in plaintext within source code.

## Decision

Integrated a regex-based scanning mechanism into `scanner.py` and introduced a new finding classification: `secret_detected`.

## Consequences

The scanner now flags potential security risks related to credential leakage. However, regex-based detection may introduce false positives that require manual triaging.

## Alternatives Considered

- Integration with external tools like TruffleHog or Gitleaks
- Entropy-based detection for high-randomness strings
