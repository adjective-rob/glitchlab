# ADR-004: Recursive Self-Healing Retry Loop

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The Controller previously terminated execution immediately upon a test failure after a single fix attempt. This limited the system's ability to resolve complex bugs that require iterative refinement or multiple passes of surgical code modification.

## Decision

Implemented a recursive retry mechanism within the main execution loop. The Controller now catches test failures and re-triggers the 'fix' process using surgical_blocks for up to 3 consecutive attempts before declaring a terminal failure.

## Consequences

Increased resilience in the face of complex regressions. However, this introduces longer execution times in worst-case scenarios and requires careful monitoring of token usage during repeated fix attempts.

## Alternatives Considered

- Single-pass execution with larger context windows
- Infinite retry loop with manual interrupt
- Parallel fix branch exploration
