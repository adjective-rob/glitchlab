# ADR-005: Centralized Identity and CLI Helper Refactoring

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## Context

The CLI functionality was broken due to missing helper functions and hardcoded identity strings that were inconsistent across the codebase. A centralized way to manage the application's visual identity (banners, versions) and common CLI utilities was required.

## Decision

Created a dedicated `glitchlab/identity.py` module to encapsulate branding assets and metadata. Refactored `glitchlab/cli.py` to import from this central source and implemented missing helper functions to ensure command execution parity.

## Consequences

The CLI is now functional and branding is consistent. Future changes to the app's name, version, or ASCII art only need to be updated in `identity.py`. Developers must now use the provided helper functions in `cli.py` rather than implementing ad-hoc logic for common tasks.

## Alternatives Considered

- Hardcoding strings directly in cli.py
- Using environment variables for identity metadata
